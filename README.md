# Pomodoro Timer

[App Demo](https://pomodoro-timer-one-iota.vercel.app/)

### Instructions
To use this application, set a break time and a focus time and hit play. The timer will automatically run through the focus time, alert you with an alarm, and start the break timer. This process will continue until the user presses the stop button.

### Technologies:
- React Library
- Bootstrap/CSS

### Tools used
- VSCode
- GitHub
I used the React Library because of its unique ability to partially render a page without the need to reload which is essential since the timer needs to re-render periodically without user initiation. I also utilized Bootstrap CSS Framework which allowed me to focus on the development of functionality over stylization, without compromising on style.

### Objective
This project demonstrates the ability to work with rendering and state management using React as well as competency in Bootstrap CSS Framework:
- Make use of states across multiple components
- Handle all of the race conditions
- Utilize props and the downward flow of information 
- Use of Bootstrap Framework to design, and create the progress bar
- Implement start, break, and pause logic through buttons and event handlers
