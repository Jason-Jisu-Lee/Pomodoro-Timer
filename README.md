# Pomodoro Timer

[App Demo](https://pomodoro-timer-liard.vercel.app/)
## Summary
The 'Pomodoro Technique' is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

This timer application employs the Pomodoro technique in which the user can change interval and break lengths.

## Instructions
To use this application, set a break time and a focus time and hit play. The timer will automatically run through the focus time, alert you with an alarm, and start the break timer. This process will continue until the user presses the stop button.

## Objective
This project demonstrates the ability to work with rendering and state management using React as well as competency in Bootstrap CSS Framework:
- Make use of states across multiple components
- Handle all of the race conditions
- Utilize props and the downward flow of information 
- Use of Bootstrap Framework to design, and create the progress bar
- Implement start, break, and pause logic through buttons and event handlers

## Technologies:
- React Library
- Bootstrap/CSS

## Tools used
- VSCode
- GitHub
I used the React Library because of its unique ability to partially render a page without the need to reload which is essential since the timer needs to re-render periodically without user initiation. I also utilized Bootstrap CSS Framework which allowed me to focus on the development of functionality over stylization, without compromising on style.
