# Pomodoro Timer

[App Demo](https://pomodoro-timer-one-iota.vercel.app/)

### Instructions
To use this application, set a break time and a focus time and hit play. The timer will automatically run through the focus time, alert you with an alarm, and start the break timer. This process will continue until the user presses the stop button.

### Technologies:
- React Library
- Bootstrap/CSS

### Tools used
- VSCode
- GitHub
I used the React Library because of its unique ability to partially render a page without the need to reload which is essential since the timer needs to re-render periodically without user initiation. I also utilized Bootstrap CSS Framework which allowed me to focus on the development of functionality over stylization, without compromising on style.

### Objective
This project demonstrates the ability to work with rendering and state management using React
How to utilize state across multiple components.
How to eliminate the chance for race conditions.
How to correctly utilize props and the downward flow of information as it relates to React.
Proper utilization of a Bootstrap progress bar. Overall a very fun challenge that lead me to many fun discoveries and lots of fun puzzles & problems!
